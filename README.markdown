# Droid-Fu - for your Android needs

Droid-Fu is an effort to collect solutions for common concerns in Android applications, especially those Web based. Currently it mostly contains code which I pulled out of Qype Radar, and which I believe may prove useful to other developers. This is VERY much a work-in-progress, and both content and API are still in flux. There is not much documentation (yet), and I intend to change that. For now, you may want to read all related articles [here](http://en.wordpress.com/tag/droid-fu/). You can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/twoofour).

## What does it offer?

Droid-Fu offers both support classes meant to be used alongside existing Android code, as well as self-contained components such as new adapters and widgets. This includes:

  * application life-cycle helpers
  * better support for background tasks
  * easy and robust HTTP messaging
  * (remote) image handling
  * custom adapters and views

I suggest you read the [introductory article](http://brainflush.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/introducing-droid-fu-for-android-betteractivity-betterservice-and-betterasynctask/) here, and everything that follows.

## How do I use it?

Droid-Fu is deployed as a JAR. Just link it to your app.

## How is it licensed?

Droid-Fu is free and open source and may be used under the terms of the Apache License, version 2.
