# IMPORTANT NOTICE
This project has been discontinued. We are putting all our efforts into [ignition](https://github.com/kaeppler/ignition) now, which is basically a rewritten but API breaking version of Droid-Fu that aims to have better project structure, better and less intrusive APIs, better documentation (we have samples now!) and proper release and issue management.

Over time, we will try to address bugs reported against Droid-Fu directly in ignition (in case they still apply), same for pull requests.

THANKS!

I have moved the previous contents of this README over to the [project wiki](https://github.com/kaeppler/droid-fu/wiki).
